# Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform

This is a complete, feature-rich E-Commerce Application built from the ground up with a modern, type-safe technology stack. The Project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my Full-Stack Development capabilities, from Database design to a performant, server-rendered Frontend.

## Core Features

- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Built with Next.js App Router, leveraging Server Components for data fetching and API Routes for backend logic.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration, login and session management implemented with NextAuth.js.
- **Product Catalog:** A complete product system with categories, search and detailed product pages.
- **Presistent Shopping Cart:** Client-side cart state managed with Zustand, synchronized with the database for authenticated users.
- **Complex Business Logic:** Features a custom **PC Builder** interface with real-time component compatibility validation.
- **Database & ORM:** Powered by a PostgreSQL database managed with the type-safe Prisma ORM.
