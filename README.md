A feature-rich, Full-Stack E-Commerce Application built with Next.js, TypeScript and Prisma.
The Project showcases a complete shopping experience, from Product discovery to User Account Management and includes a sophisticated "Demo Mode" for a secure and cost-effective portfolio showcase.

## Key Features

* **Complete Shopping Experience:** Browse products on the homepage, use a detailed search page with multi-faceted filtering (category, brand, price, rating) and view individual product details.
* **Persistent Cart & Wishlist:** Guest users carts and wishlists are saved to `localStorage`. Upon login, this data is seamlessly synced and merged with their account's database records.
* **Secure Authentication:** Full user authentication flow (register, login, logout) implemented with NextAuth.js, including credential validation and session management.
* **Comprehensive User Dashboard:** A client-side rendered dashboard where authenticated users can:
    * View their account homepage.
    * Update their personal profile information.
    * Manage payment methods.
    * View and manage their cart and wishlist.
    * (Coming Soon) View and manage their order history.
* **Architectural Excellence:**
    * **"Demo Mode":** A project-wide flag that switches the application between a "Live Mode" (connected to a real PostgreSQL database) and a "Demo Mode".
    * In Demo Mode, all database writes are intercepted and simulated using client-side state (`localStorage` and in-memory variables), preserving backend resources while providing a fully interactive user experience.
    * **Server-First with Next.js App Router:** Utilizes Server Components for fast initial page loads and data fetching, while isolating interactivity in Client Components for a modern, performant architecture.
    * **Centralized Data Layer:** All server-side Prisma queries are centralized and cached for efficiency.
    * **Component Architecture:** Adheres to the "Server-First" paradigm by using Server Components for data fetching and static content, while cleanly isolating interactive logic into small, performant Client Components.

   ```

4. **Push the database schema:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

5. **Seed the database with initial data:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```
